# TripReservationProject

The Trip reservation project is a project done in IDE Rider. You will need to be able to run C# projects on your computer, meaning you will need at least the DotNet7 framework.

1.	You will download the Zip Folder that will contain all the necessary files for the console application.

2.	Unzip the folder into a location you are aware of.
3.	Open the terminal and go to the project folder you just downloaded.
4.	Type in terminal command “dotnet run” once you are in the folder, this will begin executing the project.

4.1.	There might be some issues with your security. If on mac and it says its not secure, find the executable in finder and hold control while you press open to let the executable bypass security.

5.	If you are still having issues, simply open it up in your IDE and press run like you would with any other project.

6.	You should now be able to use the trip reservation system!
